# Spamurai™ for Android
Manage spam calls on Android phones

The goal of the Spamurai™ Android app is to give users different options in handling potential spam calls

**Where We Are**
- User has option to turn the phone ringer off if an incoming number is not in their contacts.

**What's Next**
- Ability to report past callers as spam from the app
- Block 'straight-to-voicemail' spam. This is where the telemarketer calls the phone, then within a second 
calls a second time (sending the second call to voicemail), then hangs up the initial call. To work around this,
maybe the app denies sequential calls that are less than 10 seconds apart.
